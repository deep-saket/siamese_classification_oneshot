# Object Classification using Siamese Net and Triplet Loss

1. This repo contains an implementation of siamese network using triplett loss for object identification. <br>
2. The backbone used for this network in VGG19 having pretrained imagenet weights. <br>
3. This model was build for research and experiment

## Future Work
1. Accuracy, ROC curve to be implemented and integrated in the evaluation subroutine. <br>
2. To be trained with more data and mode classes. <br>
3. Add demo script

## Dataset
1. Its a very small dataset with 83 classes <br>
